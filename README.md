# Realms Maps

This repository contains all input files for Crossfire and Trilands.
Maps and resource packs are stored in the `maps` and `resource-packs` folders. These are taken by the code and compiled into the final map artifact in `out/<name>`.
The datapacks are written in Kore, a Kotlin library which allows you to write datapacks in code.
